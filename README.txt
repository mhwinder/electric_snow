ELECTRIC SNOW READ ME

    INSTALLATION
To install Electric Snow simply move "electric_snow.nds" onto your 
microSD card and you are good to go. Electric Snow will create 
a data directory on the root of your SD card and save the highscore
in "data/electricsnow.txt".

    CONTROLS
To play the game touch and hold the bottom screen, move the stylus
across the screen and collect presents while avoiding falling snow.
Hitting just about any button will use one of your 3 bombs clearing
the screen.

    CREDITS
